# No SQL Injection Writeup

NoSQL is a database format that is more flexible than SQL and does not have as much syntax.
This allows for data to be sent to the login form that can possibly execute commands within
the database. Sending malicious code through a form to manipulate data is known as an injection.
Without proper santiation NoSQL is not secure for data storage. 

## Payload

myjson = {
    "email": "picoplayer355@picoctf.org", 
    "password": "{\"$ne\": null}"
}

The payload for this injection starts with the email found in the server.py file. We see a form 
for a default user that has the username "pico" and the email "picoplayer355@picoctf.org". Using this
information we know the email section of the login form, now we need to find the password. The command
"{\"$ne\": null} is a MongoDB command that means "not equal: null", or in other words the password is 
not equal to null. As we have previously found the email section within the database we can be certain 
that the password not equal to none is True, allowing us to bypass the password of the login. 

## Flag

The response to the request POST is success and returns a token.
token":"cGljb0NURntqQmhEMnk3WG9OelB2XzFZeFM5RXc1cUwwdUk2cGFzcWxfaW5qZWN0aW9uXzVlMjQ1ZDZlfQ=="
This token is in base64 and decoding it gives us the flag
