# Insp3ct0r


## Background

The description of the challenge says that the code may need some inspection. Inspecting the webpage using developer tools is
the hint to finding our flag.


## Solution

Visiting the page source in the developer tools we can find the first part of our flag commented out in the source code. [html](html1.png)

Next we can click on the link to the css file from within the html file and we find the second part of our flag. [css](css2.png)

Finally we can find the last third of our flag by visiting the javascript file of our webpage. [js](js3.png)

Concatenating our thirds we get the complete flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}.
