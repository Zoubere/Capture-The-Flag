# Includes


## Background

This challenge has files 'included' in the html, in other words multiple files come together to display the webpage. 
Often css styling and javascript files are used all within the same webpage.


## Solution

By viewing the source code of the webpage we can find a css file which has the first part of the flag within it. Then
navigating to the javascript file we can find the second half of our flag. flag: picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
