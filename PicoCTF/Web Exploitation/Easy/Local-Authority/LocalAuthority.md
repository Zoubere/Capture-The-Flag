# Local Authority

## Background

Authorization is usually done through the backend and not the client end otherwise the password can be found 
within the source files. The webpage this challenge directs to is a form that has a username and password.
Our objective is to find the right combination of username and password to log us into the system.


## Solution

To start off I'll be viewing the website's source code to get a hint at how we can log into the webpage. There's nothing 
of use within the homepage's html file however, the log in failed page has a different source code which shows us how 
the authorization is handled. There is also a javascript file named 'secure.js' which as expected contains the values
for the username and password fields.[secure.js](authorization.png)

After entering the username and password into the fields we're redirected to a webpage containing the flag.
