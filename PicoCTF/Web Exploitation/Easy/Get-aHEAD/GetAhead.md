# Get aHead


## Background

There are many different request methods that can be sent to a server to retrieve data. The title of this
challenge Get-aHead suggests we use the head method to retrieve data from the server. The difference between
the HEAD method and the GET method is that the HEAD method retrieves the same metadata in the form of headers, 
but not the response body. 


## Solution

Looking at the requests we can see the red color uses a GET request to change the webpage, and the blue color
sends a POST request to the webpage. Using burpsuite we can send custom requests to the web server and see how it 
processes them. Although the GET method doesn't return anything of value, using the HEAD method with the ? delimiter 
returns us the flag in the response message. [flag](flag.png)
