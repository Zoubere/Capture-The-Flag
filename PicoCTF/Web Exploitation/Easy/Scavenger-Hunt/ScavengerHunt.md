# Scavenger Hunt


## Background

Scavenger hunts are games where the creator of the game hides things in a list and the players are meant
to find them with the help of hints left by the creator. For this web challenge, a scavenger hunt would likely 
mean finding all of the sub-directories of a web page. Directory busting is normally not allowed in capture the flag
challenges so we will use common directories and the creators hints to find the flag.



## Solution 

The first part of the flag can be found directly on the homepage by viewing the source. [homepage](homepage.png)

The second part of the flag can be found in the css of the index file. [css](css2.html) 

After looking around for a while I decided to check the robots.txt file and found the third part of the flag, and a hint towards the fourth part. [robots](robots3.png) 

The webpage is being stored on an apache server, apache servers often have htacess files to make configuration changes on a directory basis, as per the apache.org website.

Lastly after finding the fourth flag our final hint is Mac computers and 'Store' which is referring to .DS_Store, hidden files created by MAC 
devices to store infromation on folder preferences. Finally our flag is complete. [ds_store](ds_store5.png)
