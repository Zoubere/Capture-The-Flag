# Mind your Ps and Qs Write Up


The ctf gives us the values of the public key E, the public key N and the value of the ciphertext C.
With this information we can plug in the values into a decoder (dcode is the online decoder used for this
example) and return the plaintext flag.

 
flag = picoCTF{sma11_N_n0_g0od_55304594}
